      research focuses on studying the linkage between two important components of natural systems: pattern in the distribution and relative abundance of species biodiversity and the quantity and rate of biogeochemical cycling, resource supply, and
      plant production and ecosystem function.
      <br/>
      <br/> WALTER JETZ is associate professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and in the School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies at Yale University. He is broadly interested in global biodiversity science. His research is interdisciplinary
