## Current Working Groups ##

#### WG1: Putting species communities and their change on the map. 

Demonstrating the value and need for multi-species (inventory) data for assessing biodiversity change.

#### WG2: Biodiversity monitoring of globally distributed but readily delineated systems.

This working group aims to demonstrate the utility of a global biodiversity monitoring scheme through a case study that can be demonstrated quickly. This requires data that exists in standardized format (e.g., Map of Life, CTFS-ForestGEO). The outcome will include identification of priority sample areas for biodiversity monitoring and suggested sampling regimes to address them.

#### WG3: Biodiversity monitoring for ecosystem services.

This working group asks how we should monitor biodiversity to improve understanding and forecasting of ecosystem functions and services. The group also asks at what spatial and biological scales is it appropriate to monitor for a particular ecosystem service or function, and which global monitoring efforts should be undertaken.

#### WG4: Toward a best-possible representative global biodiversity monitoring â€“ research and data needs.

This working group aims to develop a statement for why we should monitor biodiversity, and why monitoring should be done at the global level. The group further seeks to develop goals for where global biodiversity monitoring and assessment should be in the future: 10, 25 and 50 years from now.

#### WG5: Citizen science

The scientific opportunities of a more unified collection and use of citizen science data for the assessment of biodiversity and its change.

#### WG6: Digital platform

Digital platforms for assessing global biodiversity change. Status, needs, opportunities.
